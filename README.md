# Jansen Linkage Simulation

![4-Legged Jansen Mechanism](https://github.com/cvigoe/Jansen/blob/master/jansen.gif)

4 Legged Jansen Linkage Pseudo-Static Simulation in MATLAB. Newton-Raphson is implemented to solve the system of equations describing the linkage, in either full or sequential form. The sequential Newton Rapshon appraoch differs in treating the system of 8 equations in 8 unknowns as 4 sequential pairs of 2 equations in 2 unknowns, trading numerical accuracy for modest computational efficeny improvements.

See jansen.pdf for an in-depth report on the simulation.
